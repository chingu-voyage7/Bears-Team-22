_Developed during the Chingu Voyage-7 cohort by Bears Team 22. Read more about Chingu and future cohorts [here](https://chingu.io)._


## MVP

See [the MVP spec](mvp.md).


## Development

### Getting started

First of all, obtain your Firebase SDK service account credentials (more info on this can be found in [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app)). Rename `server/sample.env` to `.env` (keep it in the `server` directory), and replace the placeholders with your credentials.

Then, run `npm run dev` to start the app in development mode or `npm start` to run it in production mode. It should then be running on http://localhost:3000, with the backend API running on http://localhost:5000.

See our backend API documentation [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/chingu-voyage7/Bears-Team-22/a666ca417134b6b29758eb851f257af446b78d61/docs/index.html).
