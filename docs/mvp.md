  - Search
    - Google type simple search box
    - Results start with tag list with number of results per tag, ordered by tag prevalence
      Search for: "migraine treatment during pregnancy" result start with:
      ☑️ Pregnancy(122), ☑️ Migraine(94), ☑️ 1st-trimester(40), ☑️ Chinese-Medicine(37), ☑️ Prevention(24), ☑️ Research(12)
      
      Unchecking a box would hide results tagged with the box's matching tag, thus filtering the results.
    - The search is done using auto-detected tags.
    - The user can remove or add tags to the search.
  - Actions add up to calculate the user's points - gamification (not necessarily in the MVP).
